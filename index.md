`What is XDIA`?
> XDIA Realism Milsim is a wargaming community with a passion for operational competence through the use of tactics drawn from real-world military doctrine. We train to execute conflict-driven, narratively connected operations with a focus on immersion and variety in scope and objective. In short, XDIA is a military simulation group that strives to do MORE. The community is the product of years of development, thousands of hours of collective experience between our leadership, and learning from our mistakes. Through these things, SPECTRE as a whole strives to produce a unique, immersive military simulation experience.
